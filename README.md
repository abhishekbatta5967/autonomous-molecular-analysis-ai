# Autonomous Molecular Analysis and Optimization using AI

## Overview
This project presents an AI-driven system for molecular analysis, reaction interpretation,
and property optimization. The platform integrates cheminformatics, 3D molecular visualization,
and large language models to assist in understanding chemical compounds and transformations
at a conceptual level.

The system is designed as a final-year engineering project with a focus on explainability,
interactivity, and modular design.
